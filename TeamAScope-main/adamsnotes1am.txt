to whoever may be reading this, some notes:
regarding css inheriting to the html files, i got that as you can see. only took 5 hours.
regarding linking to sub directories, I am lost as hell
Kyler said maybe aws is better for that
While a full transition would break my heart, I'm looking at docker files and whatnot now
We should keep it heavily in mind if someone knows it
Until then, i got a long few hours ahead of me
bon voyage
